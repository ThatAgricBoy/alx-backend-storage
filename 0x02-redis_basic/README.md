# Redis

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and
message broker. It is often referred to as a "data structure server" because it allows you to work with
various data types, including strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, bitmaps, and more. It also provides
built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different levels of on-disk persistence,
and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
